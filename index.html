<p>Broadly speaking, I like to design <em>things</em>. I love thinking about how things are implemented and why they work well for their intended purposes. This includes intangible things like communication itself.</p>
<p>My current interest is in crafting interactive experiences. Usually, these are for education, entertainment, or the simple joy of good UX; but sometimes, I like for them to exist solely for their own sake.</p>

<p>I am required to work a job in my country&#x27;s public service for several years after I graduate, probably starting as a software engineer in GovTech Singapore (my assigned agency).</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have much information about what I&#x27;d be doing in the other agencies I might be rotated to, so instead, here&#x27;s a list of teams (and their agencies) I&#x27;m currently interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Government Products (GovTech Singapore)</li>
<li>Government Digital Services (GovTech Singapore)</li>
<li>Curriculum Planning and Development Division (Ministry of Education)</li>
<li>National Climate Change Secretariat (Prime Minister&#x27;s Office)</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&#x27;s a list of careers I&#x27;d be interested in outside of government work:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI/UX engineer</li>
<li>video game developer, especially at an independent studio</li>
<li>instructional designer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="potential-future-colleagues"><a href="#potential-future-colleagues">Potential Future Colleagues</a></h2>
<p>These are some of the early-career individuals I found who are doing things that aren&#x27;t dissimilar to what I&#x27;d like to end up doing:</p>

</li>
<li><strong>Yusuf Amani</strong> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusufamani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>) (<a href="https://yusufamani.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a>) (<a href="https://www.behance.net/yusufamani" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behance</a>)<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>UX Engineer @ LinkedIn</li>
<li>Master&#x27;s in Human Computer Interaction &amp; Design from UC Irvine; it&#x27;s possible that to be taken seriously in HCI you actually need something like that, since CS is much too generic and tends to lean away from UX</li>
<li>Experience in user research</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Also develops Unity packages and tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of them have experience which I perhaps ought to consider acquiring myself:</p>
<ul>

<li>Teaching and policymaking experience</li>
<li>Graphic and interface design projects</li>
<li>Behavior trees and enemy AI, specifically, their implementation and design</li>
<li>Research in user patterns, game systems design, and pedagogical practices</li>
<li>Internships in related companies (N.B. these might perhaps be a little difficult to obtain)</li>
<li>More Unity development skills, especially with shader graphs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing"><a href="#closing">Closing</a></h2>
<p>With my broad interests, I don&#x27;t think that I fit neatly in any single industry or profession. My current skills, however, make it very easy for others to peg me as nothing more than a typical frontend developer.</p>
<p>While I&#x27;d probably be at least partially fulfilled in just about any career, I&#x27;d like to broaden my options a little, which is why I&#x27;m trying to gain more experience and generate concrete work in art and design (as opposed to in CS and engineering).</p></main></div></div>
